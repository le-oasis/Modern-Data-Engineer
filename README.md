# Modern-Data-Engineer
Harnessing the incredible power of Apache Spark to orchestrate consistent scalable streaming applications built from the fundamental building blocks of the modern data ecosystem, by you, the modern data engineer.


## Overview
- This repository is inspired by - https://github.com/newfront/spark-moderndataengineering - Scott Haines - Modern Data Engineering with Apache Spark
- I decided to create this repository to help me learn Apache Spark and to help others learn Apache Spark.
- I also wanted to create a repository that is more up to date with the latest versions of Apache Spark and the latest versions of the tools used in the modern data ecosystem.
- Additionally, we would be making use of Jupiter notebooks to help us learn Apache Spark. (not Zepplin as Scott did in his version).

## Caveats
- This repository is a work in progress and is not complete.
- The contents of this repo are written with macOS and Linux systems in mind.

# Volume 0:  
- I : [Getting Started with Apache Spark ](https://medium.com/@le.oasis/getting-started-with-apache-spark-sparksql-scala-with-mac-terminal-b9c9513c51f1)

Gain hands-on experience with Apache Spark using the spark-shell by delving into my comprehensive [Medium article](https://medium.com/@le.oasis/getting-started-with-apache-spark-sparksql-scala-with-mac-terminal-b9c9513c51f1). Discover the intricacies of Spark and learn how to write, test, and deploy Spark applications with ease.

# Volume 2:  
- This chapter builds on the previous one by exploring the process of reading, transforming, and writing structured data through the DataFrame API and Spark SQL.
- We will be using the [Spark SQL and DataFrames](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) documentation as a reference.
- The chapter introduces Docker runtime and Jupyter, which will be essential tools for data engineers.
