# Modern-Data-Engineer
Harnessing the incredible power of Apache Spark to orchestrate consistent scalable streaming applications built from the fundamental building blocks of the modern data ecosystem, by you, the modern data engineer.


## Overview
- This repository is inspired by - https://github.com/newfront/spark-moderndataengineering - Scott Haines - Modern Data Engineering with Apache Spark
- I decided to create this repository to help me learn Apache Spark and to help others learn Apache Spark.
- I also wanted to create a repository that is more up to date with the latest versions of Apache Spark and the latest versions of the tools used in the modern data ecosystem.
- Additionally, we would be making use of Jupiter notebooks to help us learn Apache Spark. (not Zepplin as Scott did in his version).

## Caveats
- This repository is a work in progress and is not complete.
- The contents of this repo are written with macOS and Linux systems in mind.
